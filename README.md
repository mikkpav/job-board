# Job Board

A lightweight job board app built with React.  

This is the first project I completed after transitioning from iOS development into learning modern web development with React.

## ‚ú® Purpose

This project is part of my learning journey into front-end web development.  
The goal was to get comfortable with building and styling a complete app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and React.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- CSS Modules
- Local Storage
- Framer Motion (for animations)

## üìö What I Practiced & Learned

- Setting up a modern React + TypeScript project using Vite
- Component-driven development
- State management using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Prop drilling and component communication
- Basic animation with Framer Motion
- Structuring code with modular styles and a clean file architecture
- Responsive design with media queries
- Accessibility and semantic HTML (e.g., using `<dl>`, proper button behavior)
- LocalStorage usage for simple data persistence
